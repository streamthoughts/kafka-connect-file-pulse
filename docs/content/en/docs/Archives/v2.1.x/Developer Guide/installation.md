  How to install Connect File Pulse
---


**Connect FilePulse** can be installed either from [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/streamthoughts/kafka-connect-file-pulse/releases) or from [Confluent Hub](https://www.confluent.io/hub/streamthoughts/kafka-connect-file-pulse).

**Confluent Hub CLI installation**

Use the [Confluent Hub client](https://docs.confluent.io/current/confluent-hub/client.html) to install this connector with:

```bash
confluent-hub install streamthoughts/kafka-connect-file-pulse:latest
```

**Download Installation**

Download the distribution ZIP file for the latest available version.

**Example :**
```bash
export VERSION=1.3.0
curl -sSL https://github.com/streamthoughts/kafka-connect-file-pulse/releases/download/v$VERSION/streamthoughts-kafka-connect-file-pulse-$VERSION.zip
```

Extract it into one of the directories that is listed on the `plugin.path` worker configuration property.

You can also use the Confluent Hub CLI for installing it.

```bash
$ confluent-hub install --no-prompt streamthoughts-kafka-connect-file-pulse-$VERSION.zip
```
